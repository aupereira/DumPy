# DumPy
### Kind of like Numpy/Scipy but a lot worse.
DumPy is a basic library written in pure Python that implements some basic math functions built from scratch.

DumPy uses Sphinx with the Read the Docs theme for documentation. To build the documentation, navigate to the docs folder in your terminal and run the following commands:
  * <pip install -r requirements.txt>
  * <MAKE html>
The documentation will be available in the build subdirectory.
